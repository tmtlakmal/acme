# Acme: a research framework for reinforcement learning

## Overview

This codebase is built from a fork from deepmind/acme frame work. https://github.com/deepmind/acme

Following are the key files we develop for Multi-discount Q-learning. Please refer to following files for code for Multi-discount Q-learning

1. examples/gym/run_dqn.py : Main file for the execution 
2. external_env/vehicle_controller/vehicle_env_mp.py : Environment for Trajecotry + Cruis Control
3. acme/agents/tf/MOdqn/agent.py : Multi-discount Q-learning Agent (Actor + learner)
4. acme/agents/tf/MOdqn/learning.py : Multi-discount Q-learning learner
5. acme/adders/reverb/transition.py [MoNStepTransitionAdder] : Creates sample for experience replay by multipling reward vector and discount vector and the reward dependent discount function. 






```python
loop = acme.EnvironmentLoop(environment, agent)
loop.run()
```

This will run a simple loop in which the given agent interacts with its
environment and learns from this interaction. This assumes an `agent` instance
(implementations of which you can find [here][Agents]) and an `environment`
instance which implements the [DeepMind Environment API][dm_env]. Each
individual agent also includes a `README.md` file describing the implementation
in more detail. Of course, these two lines of code definitely simplify the
picture. To actually get started, take a look at the detailed working code
examples found in our [examples] subdirectory which show how to instantiate a
few agents and environments. We also include a
[quickstart notebook][Quickstart].

Acme also tries to maintain this level of simplicity while either diving deeper
into the agent algorithms or by using them in more complicated settings. An
overview of Acme along with more detailed descriptions of its underlying
components can be found by referring to the [documentation]. And we also include
a [tutorial notebook][Tutorial] which describes in more detail the underlying
components behind a typical Acme agent and how these can be combined to form a
novel implementation.

> :information_source: Acme is first and foremost a framework for RL research written by

> working order, things may break occasionally. But if so we will make our best
> effort to fix them as quickly as possible!

## Installation

We have tested `acme` on Python 3.6 & 3.7.

1.  **Optional**: We strongly recommend using a
    [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
    to manage your dependencies in order to avoid version conflicts:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv acme
    source acme/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
    ```

1.  To install the core libraries (including [Reverb], our storage backend):

    ```bash
    pip install dm-acme
    pip install dm-acme[reverb]
    ```

1.  To install dependencies for our [JAX]- or [TensorFlow]-based agents:

    ```bash
    pip install dm-acme[tf]
    # and/or
    pip install dm-acme[jax]
    ```

1.  Finally, to install a few example environments (including [gym],
    [dm_control], and [bsuite]):

    ```bash
    pip install dm-acme[envs]
    ```
