  This provides an implementation of the `Actor` interface which acts and
  learns. It takes as input instances of both `acme.Actor` and `acme.Learner`
  classes, and implements the policy, observation, and update methods which
  defer to the underlying actor and learner.

  The only real logic implemented by this class is that it controls the number
  of observations to make before running a learner step. This is done by
  passing the number of `min_observations` to use and a ratio of
  `observations_per_step`

  Note that the number of `observations_per_step` which can also be in the range
  [0, 1] in order to allow more steps per update.
